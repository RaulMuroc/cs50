Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations <= 10000 is kind of lineal increasement. When it is >10000 it starts to increase exponencially.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions are stabilized (lineal increasement) until up to 10000 simulations. When it is higher it increases exponencially.
