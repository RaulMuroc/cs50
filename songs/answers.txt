1) If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    The six chosen colors that go into the makeup of an individual’s audio aura are purple, green, pink, orange, yellow, and blue.
    Per Spotify, purple represents passionate people who listen to music to “get amped up, entertained, and moving,”
    while people with a green aura are said to be “calm, analytical, and introspective”.
    Such people typically tune in to “complex music to tame their fast-moving minds,” said Spotify.
    Pink represents the hopelessly romantic and the music they listen to is also mostly optimistic and filled with wonder, just like the listeners themselves.
    People with an orange aura are rebellious and prefer “high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds,” while people with yellow auras want their music to keep them focused and motivated.
    Finally, blue represents emotional people and they typically choose music that expresses their feelings perfectly.

    In this case it would have an Aura: purple and orange.

2) Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    By talking to Spotify. Example -> Roberto said that audio auras are an extension of each individual as most people listen to music to soothe their souls
    rather than pretend to be someone they are not. “I feel so connected to Audio Auras because whatever that reflects, it’s an extension of you.
